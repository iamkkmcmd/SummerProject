##  :beginner: Introduction
This study aims to examine the relationship between bank vulnerability and firm-level crash risk in the Indian market during COVID period. The research will employ historical data and econometric methods to analyze the effect of bank-specific factors such as MES (Marginal Expected Shortfall) and firm-specific factors such as industry type on the crash risk of individual firms in India. By focusing on the Indian market, the study will provide a unique perspective on how bank vulnerability impacts firm-level risk in an emerging economy. The results of this study will offer valuable insights for policymakers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders in understanding the transmission of financial stress from the banking sector to the real economy in India. The findings can also inform decisions on financial stability in the Indian market, especially during economic stress periods.
